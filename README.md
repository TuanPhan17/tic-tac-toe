## 🧩 Project Overview  
This is my first submission of the **Tic-Tac-Toe Game** project.  
The goal of this program is to simulate a simple text-based Tic-Tac-Toe experience using Python.

## 🧠 Current Features (Version 1)
✅ **Welcome Message:**  
Displays a friendly greeting and asks for the player’s name.  

✅ **Difficulty Selection:**  
Player can choose between **Easy**, **Medium**, or **Hard** mode (logic to be added later).  

✅ **Turn Order Selection:**  
Asks the player if they want to go first or let the computer start.  

✅ **Symbol Choice:**  
Player can choose between **X** or **O** (computer automatically gets the other).  

✅ **Game Board Setup:**  
Displays a clean, formatted **3×3 grid** representing the board (numbers 1–9).  
Allows the player to place a move with full **input validation** to prevent invalid choices.

## 🔜 Next Update (Version 2)
In the next submission, I will:
- Implement **computer logic** for Easy, Medium, and Hard modes.  
- Add the **game algorithm** to alternate turns between player and computer.  
- Include **winner detection** and **draw conditions**.  
- Save move logs to a text file (`tictactoe.txt`).
